text: Let’s say your team is working for the Public Building Service, an arm of
  the GSA that is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all
  government buildings. They’ve asked you to create a feature where a
  building inspector can upload photos of their building inspection findings
  so they can document them visually and ensure issues are fixed. How would
  you approach the design and build for this?
follow ups:
  - If you only had a week to work on this problem, what would you do first?
  - text: How would you approach scaling?
    children:
      - "Note: For front-end developers, focus on interactions(such as
        navigating sharing with many users) and robust rendering (such as
        addressing albums with many images) rather than back-end database and
        static storage aspects."
  - "[If the response doesn't mention users] How would you make sure this
    solution works for users?"
great:
  - What a great answer!
  - Oh, good observation
warning:
  - Let's ask more probing questions about this
  - Oop
