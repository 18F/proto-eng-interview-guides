# Technical Interview

## Problem Solving

- Let’s say your team is working for the Public Building Service, an arm of the GSA that is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of all government buildings. They’ve asked you to create a feature where a building inspector can upload photos of their building inspection findings so they can document them visually and ensure issues are fixed. How would you approach the design and build for this?
   - If you only had a week to work on this problem, what would you do first?
   - How would you approach scaling?
      - Note: For front-end developers, focus on interactions(such as navigating sharing with many users) and robust rendering (such as addressing albums with many images) rather than back-end database and static storage aspects.
   - [If the response doesn&#39;t mention users] How would you make sure this solution works for users?
- Tell me about a difficult technical problem that you helped solve: what was the problem, and how was it solved?
   - Did you get stuck? Did you ask for help?
   - What other options did you consider? Why didn&#39;t you go with those?

## Agile Orientation

- Tell me about your experience with agile or other collaborative working styles. How does working in an agile way affect the technical choices you make?
   - If the candidate hasn’t worked in an agile environment before, describe how we work, and determine their willingness to work in that way (cross disciplinary self organizing team)
   - Can you give me a specific example? (a good follow-up for candidates with general, buzzword-y answers)
   - (For candidates who’ve experienced agile development before): What worked about that method of practicing agile? What could have gone better?
